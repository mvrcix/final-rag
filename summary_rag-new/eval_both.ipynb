      "\n",
      "1. Turn off the vacuum cleaner and unplug it: Before attempting to clean the Mini Turbo Brush, make sure the vacuum cleaner is turned off and unplugged from the wall outlet. This will prevent any accidental start-ups or electrical shocks.\n",
      "2. Remove any loose debris: Use your hands or a soft brush to gently remove any loose debris or hair that may be wrapped around the brush roll. Avoid using force or scrubbing too hard, as this can damage the brush or the vacuum cleaner.\n",
      "3. Use compressed air: If there are small debris particles stuck inside the Mini Turbo Brush, try using a can of compressed air to blow them out. Hold the can upside down and spray the debris away from the brush roll.\n",
      "4. Use a soft-bristled brush: For more stubborn debris or hair that is wrapped around the brush roll, use a soft-bristled brush (like a makeup brush) to gently scrub it away. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as you don't want to damage the brush or the vacuum cleaner.\n",
      "5. Check the Mini Turbo Brush filter: If the debris is stuck in the filter of the Mini Turbo Brush, remove and clean it according to the manufacturer's instructions. This will ensure that the brush can continue to function properly.\n",
      "6. Consider replacing the Mini Turbo Brush: If the Mini Turbo Brush is frequently getting clogged or damaged, you may want to consider replacing it with a new one. This can be especially important if you have pets or allergies, as the brush can become less effective at picking up pet hair and dander over time.\n",
